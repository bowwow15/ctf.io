# CTF.io

This project is not finished. Please contribute!

The main goals of this project are to:

* Create a 2d game, inspired by surviv.io, but with a capture-the-flag styled theme.
* Make an API capable of enabling people to easily create their own ctf.io server.
* Create a mobile client for iOS and Android.
